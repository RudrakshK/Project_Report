\tab “Cleanliness is next to Godliness”
Mahatma Gandhi said these words in the previous century, yet still we witness the lack of a clean environment everywhere we go. This was the backbone idea, the critical problem we wanted to solve when we were first ideating about our project. 

\tab Cow dung is a very common junk prevalent on roads and streets. Most of the time it’s washed away, and whenever it gets cleaned off, it has to be done manually, using scrapers and buckets. This project aims to reduce the manual labour required to clean off the cow dung significantly, while also promoting collection of cow dung for other processing.

\tab Cow shelters still use primitive techniques and tools to collect cow dung inside the sheds, taking into consideration the large shed area that needs to be cleaned, it becomes a tiring and a very long task. Our cow dung collection machine will be of great benefit for shelter maintenance as it has fast collection and high storage capabilities.
