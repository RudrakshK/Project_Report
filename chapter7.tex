\chapter{Conclusion} \label{Conclusion}

This report was prepared to summarise the philosophy and decisions made in the design process. It is also to highlight the need of such a machine and it's practical useful applications.

\section{Summary} \label{Summary}
The machine being prototyped is a cow dung collecting machine. It's constructed mainly using stainless steel so that it's non corrosive and durable while also being tough and hard. The main working component is the collecting mechanism, which is, 12 blades mounted on 2 chains to convey the collected cow dung to the collecting bin. The collection is facilitated by the front scraper which scrapes cow dung off the ground. The machine moves on 4 wheels, 2 are mounted on a solid axle at front which is linked to the collecting mechanism to transmit power to drive it, the rear wheels are omnidirectional to improve mobility and maneuverability.



\section{Future Work} \label{Future Work}
Further iterations of this machine can look to reduce the gross weight. Additional mechanisms can be designed and implemented such as a water pump to flush out water from underneath to clean the surface it's being driven on. Modular attachments can be implemented to improve the general usability of the machine, to not only collect cow dung, but to collect dry and wet waste, collect agricultural industry waste.
